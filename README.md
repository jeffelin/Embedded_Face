## About the Code

The file `spy_mmtest.py` contains test cases for command control sensing and receiving data, specifically for mmWave human detection. Additional commands can be added manually using hexadecimal definitions. To implement new commands, define a function for the desired command following the existing structure.

For more details, refer to the `mmwaves_sensor` directory.
